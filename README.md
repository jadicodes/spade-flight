## Mechanics
In Spade Flight, you possess a spade (card game suit) and must jump through pipes that look like kings in order not to die. 

## Reflection

This was the first game I completed solo in Godot. I had taken a class on the engine and had completed a game jam using it, but had not yet used it completely solo. It was the start of a summer long project of making 4 different solo games.

Nothing in this project challenged me too much, as all the features were nodes I had used before (CharacterBody2D, Area2D, StaticBody2D, and OffScreenNotifier). The value came from proving to myself that I could do it. I love making games, and after a year of trying to make games, I am now ready to begin producing them all the way through. For this game, I made all of the assets besides those listed below.
